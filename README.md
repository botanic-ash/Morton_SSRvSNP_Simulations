# Overview

This repository is forked from Austin Koontz's Morton_SSRvSNP_Simulations which quantifies how measures of *ex situ* conservation differ between RADseq and microsatellite markers.

Simulations using different marker types (microsatellites, or "MSAT", and SNP markers, or "DNA")  are performed using the [fastSimcoal2 software](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal27/) and the [strataG](https://github.com/EricArcher/strataG) R package.
**NOTE: Currently this project does not incorporate SNP markers since strataG would not load onto Ash's computer. However, it could and ideally would be incorporated (potentially from a different simulation software like SLiM or plink).**

### SimulationOutputs (untouched from the forked repository)
This folder contains 2 subfolders, one for simulation outputs using microsatellite markers ([MSAT_marker](https://github.com/botanic-ash/Morton_SSRvSNP_Simulations/tree/main/SimulationOutputs/MSAT_marker))
and one for simulation outputs using SNP markers ([DNA_marker](https://github.com/botanic-ash/Morton_SSRvSNP_Simulations/tree/main/SimulationOutputs/DNA_marker)). 

Within each of these are folders for each simulation scenario containing Arlequin output files.
Additionally, simulation parameter files, and the log files for simulations, are contained in the top directory of each marker type subfolder.

### RScripts
This folder contains the R scripts used to specify simulation parameters, run simulations, convert Arlequin outputs to genind objects, and process those genind objects.

Functions used repeatedly throughout the scripts are declared in [SSRvSNP_Sim_functions.R](https://github.com/akoontz11/Morton_SSRvSNP_Simulations/blob/main/RScripts/SSRvSNP_Sim_functions.R).

The script [GenerateFSCparams.R](https://github.com/akoontz11/Morton_SSRvSNP_Simulations/blob/main/RScripts/GenerateFSCparams.R) specifies the parameters used for
MSAT and DNA fastSimcoal2 simulations, and runs those simulations, storing the results to .params R objects (or genind objects). Note that every time this script is 
run or sourced, new fastSimcoal2 simulation output files will populate the specified [SimulationOutputs](https://github.com/akoontz11/Morton_SSRvSNP_Simulations/tree/main/SimulationOutputs) directory (see below).

The script [archived_SimulationsScenarios.R](https://github.com/akoontz11/Morton_SSRvSNP_Simulations/blob/main/RScripts/archived_SimulationScenarios.R) contains simulation parameters for
scenarios we explored, but ultimately ended up not using. This script is kept here for documentation purposes.

The script [subsetAndResample.R](https://github.com/akoontz11/Morton_SSRvSNP_Simulations/blob/main/RScripts/subsetAndResample.R) is used to summarize the allele frequency distributions of each simulation
scenario (for each marker type), and then randomly sample each object to model *ex situ* conservation.
